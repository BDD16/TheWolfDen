## Abstract

In an increasingly interconnected digital landscape, reliable and modular communication systems are essential. This paper introduces the **Riddler Chat System**, a platform that elegantly combines the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm with socket-based communication mechanisms. The system balances scalability, clarity, and aesthetic principles such as the Golden Ratio to offer a robust foundation for secure and extensible chat applications.

## 1. Introduction

The Riddler Chat System is conceived not merely as a proof of concept, but as a scalable, educational framework for building resilient communication infrastructures. Integrating modern Python practices with classical networking techniques, the project encompasses four primary modules: **LandingPage.py**, **communication_base.py**, **server.py**, and **`__main__.py`**. Each module plays a distinct yet interconnected role in orchestrating a seamless user experience.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

```plaintext
__main__.py âž” Launches QApplication
     â‡“
LandingPage (View Layer)
    â¤·      â¤¸
ReceiveController  MessageController  VillainController
    â‡“             â‡“            â‡“
RecvChatBox     MsgChatBox     VillainList
 â‡„ CommunicationBase (Networking backend)
      â‡“
MembershipServer (Server backend - TCP/UDP muxing)
```

The system follows a tightly coupled MVC design philosophy, emphasizing modularity, scalability, and aesthetic coherence.

## 3. LandingPage.py: The View Layer

The **LandingPage** serves as the primary user interface, combining multiple interactive components:

- **RecvChatBox:** Displays incoming messages.
- **MsgChatBox:** Enables users to compose and dispatch messages.
- **VillainList:** Manages a dynamic list of active users.
- **Password Protect Button:** Placeholder for future secure session features.
- **Send Button:** Initiates message transmission.

### Design Considerations

- Utilization of Golden Ratio for layout aesthetics.
- Consistent retro-neon color schemes.
- Explicit `self.` registration for runtime widget discovery.

## 4. `__main__.py`: Application Entry Point

```python
from PyQt5 import QApplication
import sys
from chatclient.TheRiddlerChatSystem.Views.MainWindow import MainWindow

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    ex = MainWindow()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

The `__main__.py` module initiates the PyQt5 event loop, bootstrapping the application with minimal overhead.

## 5. communication_base.py: Abstracted Networking Logic

The **CommunicationBase** class encapsulates low-level networking operations, adhering to an abstract base class structure.

### Core Features

- **Command Parsing:** Dynamic recognition and construction of communication commands.
- **Buddy List Synchronization:** Thread-safe operations using locks.
- **UDP Messaging:** Efficient, connectionless message distribution.

---

## 6. server.py: The MembershipServer Backend

The **MembershipServer** is responsible for maintaining the chat network state, client sessions, and message routing.

### Functional Highlights

- **Dual Socket Initialization:** TCP for reliable handshakes; UDP for lightweight notifications.
- **Threaded TCP Handling:** Parallel client management.
- **Command Multiplexing:** TCP/UDP command separation via Mux classes.
- **Membership Management:** Lock-protected user database.

### Key Components

- `TcpMux`: TCP protocol handler.
- `UdpMux`: UDP broadcast manager.
- `MembershipServer`: The orchestrator ensuring session and message integrity.

### Hidden Features and Behaviors

- **Server-Independent Authenticated Networks:** Clients can continue communication if the server goes offline after initial authentication (ACPT).
- **Dynamic Shutdown Control:** Closing the server after authentication freezes the network, allowing peer-only communication without newcomers.
- **Known Network Persistence:** Once authenticated, the peer network self-sustains without central oversight.

## 7. Future Work: Symmetric/Asymmetric Encryption Switching

Enhancing the security layer is a natural next step.

### Proposed Architecture

```plaintext
[User Interaction]
    â‡’ EncryptionModeController
        â‡’ set_symmetric() or set_asymmetric()
        â‡’ Controllers notified
            â‡’ Encryption/Decryption dynamically adapted
```

- **Symmetric:** AES-256, ChaCha20 for efficiency.
- **Asymmetric:** RSA-4096, ECC for secure handshakes.

---

## 8. Conclusion

The Riddler Chat System demonstrates a practical and scalable approach to building modular, resilient, and aesthetic communication platforms. By adhering to MVC patterns and socket communication principles, and embedding resilience mechanisms such as server-independent peer persistence, it stands as a case study in modern secure communication frameworks.

The system's hidden peer resilience capabilities offer a promising direction for real-world deployments, particularly in dynamic, semi-trusted, or adversarial environments.
